		{
			question: "How is PhD abroad different from PhD in India?",
			answer: "PhD programs abroad typically offer structured coursework, diverse research facilities, international collaborations, and better funding opportunities. They often have shorter durations (3-4 years) with comprehensive stipends covering tuition and living expenses. We help you understand these differences and choose programs that offer the best research environment for your field."
		},
		{
			question: "Do I need a master's degree for PhD abroad?",
			answer: "Requirements vary by country and university. US and Canada often accept students directly after bachelor's degree, while UK, Europe, and Australia typically require a master's degree. Some programs offer integrated master's-PhD tracks. We help you identify programs that match your educational background and career aspirations."
		},
		{
			question: "How do I find a PhD supervisor abroad?",
			answer: "Finding the right supervisor is crucial for PhD success. We help you research faculty members whose work aligns with your interests, prepare compelling emails to reach out to potential supervisors, and develop strong research proposals that demonstrate your capability and fit with their research group."
		},
		{
			question: "What funding options are available for PhD abroad?",
			answer: "International PhD students can access university scholarships, government funding (like Fulbright, Commonwealth), research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and external fellowships. Many programs offer full funding covering tuition and stipend. We guide you through identifying and applying for these opportunities to minimize your financial burden."
		},
		{
			question: "What are the English language requirements for PhD abroad?",
			answer: "Most universities require IELTS (minimum 6.5-7.0) or TOEFL (minimum 90-100) scores. Some may accept alternative proof of English proficiency if you studied in English previously. Certain programs may have higher requirements. We help you understand specific requirements for your target universities and prepare accordingly."
		},
		{
			question: "How long does the PhD application process take?",
			answer: "The process typically takes 6-12 months from initial research to admission decision. This includes identifying programs and supervisors (2-3 months), preparing applications and research proposals (2-3 months), submitting applications, waiting for responses (2-4 months), and visa processing (1-2 months). We help you manage this timeline efficiently with our structured approach."
